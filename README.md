## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the chatbot running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   An active Google API Key with access to the Gemini model.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
